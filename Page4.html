            <br><h2>How Does Cryptocurrency Works?</h2><br>
            Cryptocurrencies are not regulated or controlled by any central authority hence cryptocurrency works outside the banking system using 
            different types of coins. 
            <br><br>
            <h3>1. Mining:</h3> Cryptocurrencies are generated through the process called Mining. In this process, the miners are required to solve 
            a mathematical puzzle over a specially equipped computer system to be rewarded with bitcoins in exchange.
            <br><br>
            <h3>2. Buying, selling, and storing:</h3> Users can buy cryptocurrencies from central exchanges, brokers, or individual currency owners 
            and sell crypto to them. Cryptocurrencies can be stored in wallets.
            <br><br>
            <h3>3. Investing:</h3> Cryptocurrencies can be transferred from one digital wallet to another. Cryptocurrencies can be used for the 
            following purposes:
            <br><br>
            <h4>*Buying goods and services.<br>
            *Trade-in them.<br>
            *Exchange them for cash.</h4><br><br>

            &nbsp;<h2>How To Buy Cryptocurrency?</h2><br>
            
                Cryptocurrencies are not regulated or controlled by any central authority hence cryptocurrency works outside the banking system 
                using different types of coins. 
                <br>
                <h3>There are three steps involved in buying a cryptocurrency:</h3>
                <br>
                <h4>1. Choosing a platform:</h4><br>
                <h4>There are two platforms available to choose from:</h4>
                <br>
                <h4>Traditional Brokers:</h4> There are online brokers who offer to buy and sell cryptocurrencies along with stocks, bonds, etc,
                 but they offer lower trading costs and fewer crypto features.
                <h4>Cryptocurrency exchanges:</h4> Different types of cryptocurrency exchanges are available to choose from with different 
                cryptocurrencies, wallet storage, etc.
                <br><br><h4>2. Funding your account:</h4> After choosing the platform, the next step is to fund the account. Most crypto exchanges 
                allow users to purchase cryptocurrencies using fiat currency like U.S. Dollar, the Euro, or using Credit and Debit cards, but this
                 varies from platform to platform. An important factor to consider here is the fees that include the potential deposit and withdrawal
                  transaction fees plus the trading fees. 
                <br><br>
                <h4>3. Placing an order:</h4> The order can be placed via exchanges or brokers web or mobile platform. 
                <br>
                <h4>*Select the Buy option.<br>
                *Choose the order type.<br>
                *Enter the amount of cryptocurrencies.<br>
                *Confirm the order.<br>
                *A similar process needs to be followed for selling cryptocurrencies.</h4><br><br>

                &nbsp;<h2>How To Store Cryptocurrency?</h2>
                <br>
                <h4>Once the cryptocurrency is purchased, it needs to be stored safely to protect it from hackers. The usual place to store 
                cryptocurrency is crypto wallets which can be physical devices or online software. Not all exchanges or brokers provide crypto
                wallet services. The cryptocurrencies can be stored in these four placees:</h4>
                <br><h4>1.Custodial Wallet:</h4> In this approach, a third party such as a crypto exchange stores the cryptocurrency either through
                cold storage or hot storage, or a combination of the two. This is the most simplest and convenient method for the users as it
                requires less work on the user part. 
                <br><br><h4>2.Cold Wallet:</h4> These are also known as Hardware wallets. It is an offline wallet in which hardware connects to the
                computer and stores the cryptocurrency. The device connects to the internet at the time of sending and receiving cryptocurrency but
                other than that the cryptos are safely stored offline.
                <br><br><h4>3.Hot Wallet:</h4> These are the applications that store cryptocurrencies online. These are available as desktop or 
                mobile apps.
                <br><br><h4>4.Paper Wallet:</h4> This is also known as a physical wallet. It is a printout of the public and private keys available
                as a string of characters or scannable QR codes. To send crypto scan the public and private keys and crypto will be received using
                the public keys.
