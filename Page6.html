            <h2>1)&nbsp;Cryptocurrency regulations:</h2><br>
                Globally, the crypto industry will continue to work on a precise regulation around cryptocurrency.
                The stricter regulation is the need of the hour as it will deter cybercriminals.
                The bipartisan infrastructure bill to the tune of $1.2 trillion signed by the U.S. president in 2021 includes crypto tax reporting 
                provisions expected to make it easier for the IRS to track crypto activity among Americans.
                The new regulation is expected to help investors keep records of any capital gains or losses on their crypto assets. Furthermore,
                the new rules may also make it easier for investors to report crypto transactions properly.
                Regulatory announcements may affect the cryptocurrency price in already existing volatile markets. However, many experts reiterate
                that regulation is good for the industry. Ultimately, sensible regulation will be a game-changer for everyone.

            <h2>2)&nbsp;Cryptocurrency ETF approval:</h2><br>
                The first Bitcoin ETF debuted on the New York Stock Exchange in 2021, a notable breakthrough. The development is a new and more
                conventional way to invest in crypto.However, some experts say the BITO ETF is insufficient because it may not hold the crypto
                directly even though the fund may be linked to Bitcoin. The fund has Bitcoin futures contracts.Experts state that while Bitcoin
                futures follow the general trends of the actual crypto, they may still not track the price of Bitcoin directly.

            <h2>3)&nbsp;Bitcoin to remain under pressure:</h2><br>
                Bitcoin may stay under pressure even after touching a high of around $70,000 in 2021. The year started with Bitcoin touching $29,000.
                With the massive gains, investors expect a bearish trend in the legacy cryptocurrency in 2022.
                Some experts expect bitcoin to virtually wipe out all its gains accumulated in the past year and a half. However, some experts expect
                bitcoin to resume with the crypto to crack the $100,000 mark.

            <h2>4)&nbsp;NFT Market Growth Expected to Continue:</h2><br>
                NFTs offer access to decentralized funding options, which has immensely helped artists and creators with this access. With this facet,
                they get more freedom in financing their creation.The good part is that they are pretty secure with the NFTs based on blockchain 
                technology. Plus, they help to authenticate the ownership of the digital asset.

            <h2>5)&nbsp;Web 3.0 to Enter the Mainstream:<br></h2>
                Web 3.0 is already creating many waves, and the third version of the internet must be looked out for in 2022 and beyond. People who 
                wish to fund their websites without depending on large corporations that own servers or charge hefty fees have a sustainable solution
                with Web 3.0.
                One can benefit from Web 3.0 by being able to personalize the internet. Plus, avoiding the occurrence of a single point failure
               (for example, when a specific social website crashes, it will not affect the activities during the crash period).
