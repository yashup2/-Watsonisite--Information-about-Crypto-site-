        <h3>3)&nbsp;Bitcoin</h3><br>
            Bitcoin had a price of zero when it was introduced in 2009. On July 17, 2010, its price jumped to $.09.Bitcoin's price rose again on 
            from $1 to a peak of $29.60 by June 7, 2011, a gain of 2,960% within three months.Bitcoin began the year trading at $13.28 and reached
             $230 2016–2020
            Prices slowly climbed through 2016 to over $900 by the end of the year.<br>
            In 2017, Bitcoin's price hovered around $1,000 until it broke $2,000 in mid-May and then skyrocketed to $19,345.49 on Dec. 15.In 2020, 
            the economy shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Bitcoin's price burst into action once again. The cryptocurrency started the year
             at $6,965.72. The pandemic shutdown and subsequent government policies fed investors' fears about the global economy and accelerated 
             Bitcoin's rise.Bitcoin took less than a month in 2021 to smash its 2020 price record, surpassing $40,000 by Jan. 7, 2021. By mid-April,
              Bitcoin prices reached new all-time highs of over $60,000 as Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange, went public.
            Bitcoin's price should continue to rise as long as it continues to grow in popularity and its supply cannot meet demand.

        <h3>2)&nbsp;Ethereum</h3><br>
        Ethereum greatly outpaced bitcoin in 2021, returning 399.2% as the popularity by NFTs and creation of DeFi 2.0
        But with the rise of network activity, a 50% increase in transfers in 2021, Ethereum gas fees surged. From minimums of $20 for a single
         transaction, to NFT mint prices starting around $40.Alternative budding smart contract platforms like Solana (11,178%), Avalanche (3,335%),
          and Fantom (13,207%) all had 4-5 digit percentage returns, as these protocols built out their own decentralized finance ecosystems and NFT
           markets.
        With Ethereum set to merge onto the beacon chain this year, which uses proof of stake instead of proof of work, we’ll see if 2022 brings 
        lower gas fees and retail’s return to Ethereum if the merge is successful.

        <h3>3)&nbsp;Litecoin</h3><br>
        The Litecoin price suffers and falls back to around €1 in January 2015.
        After a small rise in the spring of 2015, Litecoin enters a two-year consolidation period and its price stabilizes around €3.

        then reaches €80 in September 2017.
        In November and December 2017, Litecoin takes advantage of the cryptocurrency bubble and the price literally soars. The all-time high is set
         at around €371 on December 19, 2017, a 500% increase in 2 months!<br>
        In 2018, Litecoin suffers another crash like the entire cryptocurrency market and its price will fall back to a low around €25 on December 
        15, 2018.<br>
        In 2019, Litecoin started in a bull market and its price climbed to €145 in June 2019. It then fell back to the €50 mark in the second half
         of 2019. It has enjoyed a new bull market since the summer of 2020 and exceeded €200 in April 2021.

        <h3>4)&nbsp;Stablecoin</h3><br>
            A half-yearly research report by crypto exchange Binance has revealed that the Stablecoin market capitalisation grew by over 3,000 per 
            cent from January 2020 to January 2022. The years 2020 and 2021 witnessed the maximum growth in the Stablecoin market. That said, the 
            market shrunk by 7.7 per cent from the start of the year to June 2022, the Binance Research Report June 2022
            “They exploded in size, and following the growth of decentralised finance (DeFi), Stablecoins found more and more use-cases within the
            crypto landscape. Within just a few years, they became a central backbone of further crypto adoption, but also continued to be further
            scrutinised by regulators to find a balance between consumer protection and crypto adoption.
