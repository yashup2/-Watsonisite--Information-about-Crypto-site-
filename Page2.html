        Cryptocurrency is a digital payment system that doesn't rely on banks to verify transactions. Instead of being physical money carried 
        around and exchanged in the real world, cryptocurrency payments exist purely as digital entries to an online database describing specific 
        transactions. When you transfer cryptocurrency funds, the transactions are recorded in a public ledger. Cryptocurrency is stored in digital
        wallets.
        Cryptocurrency received its name because it uses encryption to verify transactions. This means advanced coding is involved in storing and 
        transmitting cryptocurrency data between wallets and to public ledgers. The aim of encryption is to provide security and safety.
        The first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, which was founded in 2009 and remains the best known today. Much of the interest in cryptocurrencies 
        is to trade for profit, with speculators at times driving prices skyward.<br><br>
        The Cryptocurrency is created from the proposed system and two solidity files are created to perform various functions to create it. 
        The smart contract cannot be changed once it is deployed and different tasks are performed by the smart contract automatically as programmed
        and no need for any manual operation.Smart contract needs to be audited to ensure that there is no bug or issues in the smart contract and
        smart contract audit helps to remove the design issues in the contract. The cryptocurrency is launched in the blockchain and they needs to 
        be implemented in the exchange to buy and sell and many other operations can be performed like staking and farming as they needs to be
        predefined in the smart contract.

        In cryptocurrency, “coins” (which are publicly agreed on records of ownership) are generated or produced by “miners”.
        
        <br>1)&nbsp;These miners are people who run programs on ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) devices made specifically to solve
         proof-of-work puzzles. 
        <br>2)&nbsp;The work behind mining coins gives them value, while the scarcity of coins and demand for them causes their value to fluctuate. 
        <br>3)&nbsp;Cryptocurrencies can be used for buying goods just like fiat currency & they are encrypted.
        <br>4)&nbsp;It does not exist in physical form and is not typically issued by any central authority.
